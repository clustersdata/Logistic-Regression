Logistic Regression

Classifying MNIST digits using Logistic Regression

Note

This sections assumes familiarity with the following Theano concepts: shared variables , basic arithmetic ops , T.grad , floatX. If you intend to run the code on GPU also read GPU.

Note

The code for this section is available for download here.

In this section, we show how Theano can be used to implement the most basic classifier: the logistic regression. We start off with a quick primer of the model, which serves both as a refresher but also to anchor the notation and show how mathematical expressions are mapped onto Theano graphs.

In the deepest of machine learning traditions, this tutorial will tackle the exciting problem of MNIST digit classification.
The Model

Logistic regression is a probabilistic, linear classifier. It is parametrized by a weight matrix W and a bias vector b. Classification is done by projecting an input vector onto a set of hyperplanes, each of which corresponds to a class. The distance from the input to a hyperplane reflects the probability that the input is a member of the corresponding class.

Mathematically, the probability that an input vector x is a member of a class i, a value of a stochastic variable Y, can be written as:

P(Y=i|x, W,b) &= softmax_i(W x + b) \\ &= \frac {e^{W_i x + b_i}} {\sum_j e^{W_j x + b_j}}

The modelâ€™s prediction y_{pred} is the class whose probability is maximal, specifically:

y_{pred} = {\rm argmax}_i P(Y=i|x,W,b)

The code to do this in Theano is the following:

        # initialize with 0 the weights W as a matrix of shape (n_in, n_out)
        self.W = theano.shared(
            value=numpy.zeros(
                (n_in, n_out),
                dtype=theano.config.floatX
            ),
            name='W',
            borrow=True
        )
        # initialize the biases b as a vector of n_out 0s
        self.b = theano.shared(
            value=numpy.zeros(
                (n_out,),
                dtype=theano.config.floatX
            ),
            name='b',
            borrow=True
        )

        # symbolic expression for computing the matrix of class-membership
        # probabilities
        # Where:
        # W is a matrix where column-k represent the separation hyperplane for
        # class-k
        # x is a matrix where row-j  represents input training sample-j
        # b is a vector where element-k represent the free parameter of
        # hyperplane-k
        self.p_y_given_x = T.nnet.softmax(T.dot(input, self.W) + self.b)

        # symbolic description of how to compute prediction as class whose
        # probability is maximal
        self.y_pred = T.argmax(self.p_y_given_x, axis=1)

Since the parameters of the model must maintain a persistent state throughout training, we allocate shared variables for W,b. This declares them both as being symbolic Theano variables, but also initializes their contents. The dot and softmax operators are then used to compute the vector P(Y|x, W,b). The result p_y_given_x is a symbolic variable of vector-type.

To get the actual model prediction, we can use the T.argmax operator, which will return the index at which p_y_given_x is maximal (i.e. the class with maximum probability).

Now of course, the model we have defined so far does not do anything useful yet, since its parameters are still in their initial state. The following section will thus cover how to learn the optimal parameters.

Note

Defining a Loss Function

Learning optimal model parameters involves minimizing a loss function. In the case of multi-class logistic regression, it is very common to use the negative log-likelihood as the loss. This is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the data set \cal{D} under the model parameterized by \theta. Let us first start by defining the likelihood \cal{L} and loss \ell:

\mathcal{L} (\theta=\{W,b\}, \mathcal{D}) = \sum_{i=0}^{|\mathcal{D}|} \log(P(Y=y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, W,b)) \\ \ell (\theta=\{W,b\}, \mathcal{D}) = - \mathcal{L} (\theta=\{W,b\}, \mathcal{D})

While entire books are dedicated to the topic of minimization, gradient descent is by far the simplest method for minimizing arbitrary non-linear functions. This tutorial will use the method of stochastic gradient method with mini-batches (MSGD). See Stochastic Gradient Descent for more details.

The following Theano code defines the (symbolic) loss for a given minibatch:

        # y.shape[0] is (symbolically) the number of rows in y, i.e.,
        # number of examples (call it n) in the minibatch
        # T.arange(y.shape[0]) is a symbolic vector which will contain
        # [0,1,2,... n-1] T.log(self.p_y_given_x) is a matrix of
        # Log-Probabilities (call it LP) with one row per example and
        # one column per class LP[T.arange(y.shape[0]),y] is a vector
        # v containing [LP[0,y[0]], LP[1,y[1]], LP[2,y[2]], ...,
        # LP[n-1,y[n-1]]] and T.mean(LP[T.arange(y.shape[0]),y]) is
        # the mean (across minibatch examples) of the elements in v,
        # i.e., the mean log-likelihood across the minibatch.
        return -T.mean(T.log(self.p_y_given_x)[T.arange(y.shape[0]), y])

Note

Even though the loss is formally defined as the sum, over the data set, of individual error terms, in practice, we use the mean (T.mean) in the code. This allows for the learning rate choice to be less dependent of the minibatch size.
Creating a LogisticRegression class

We now have all the tools we need to define a LogisticRegression class, which encapsulates the basic behaviour of logistic regression. The code is very similar to what we have covered so far, and should be self explanatory.

We instantiate this class as follows:


    # generate symbolic variables for input (x and y represent a
    # minibatch)
    x = T.matrix('x')  # data, presented as rasterized images
    y = T.ivector('y')  # labels, presented as 1D vector of [int] labels

    # construct the logistic regression class
    # Each MNIST image has size 28*28
    classifier = LogisticRegression(input=x, n_in=28 * 28, n_out=10)

We start by allocating symbolic variables for the training inputs x and their corresponding classes y. Note that x and y are defined outside the scope of the LogisticRegression object. Since the class requires the input to build its graph, it is passed as a parameter of the __init__ function. This is useful in case you want to connect instances of such classes to form a deep network. The output of one layer can be passed as the input of the layer above. (This tutorial does not build a multi-layer network, but this code will be reused in future tutorials that do.)

Finally, we define a (symbolic) cost variable to minimize, using the instance method classifier.negative_log_likelihood.


    # the cost we minimize during training is the negative log likelihood of
    # the model in symbolic format
    cost = classifier.negative_log_likelihood(y)

Note that x is an implicit symbolic input to the definition of cost, because the symbolic variables of classifier were defined in terms of x at initialization.
Learning the Model

To implement MSGD in most programming languages (C/C++, Matlab, Python), one would start by manually deriving the expressions for the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters: in this case \partial{\ell}/\partial{W}, and \partial{\ell}/\partial{b}, This can get pretty tricky for complex models, as expressions for \partial{\ell}/\partial{\theta} can get fairly complex, especially when taking into account problems of numerical stability.

With Theano, this work is greatly simplified. It performs automatic differentiation and applies certain math transforms to improve numerical stability.

To get the gradients \partial{\ell}/\partial{W} and \partial{\ell}/\partial{b} in Theano, simply do the following:

    g_W = T.grad(cost=cost, wrt=classifier.W)
    g_b = T.grad(cost=cost, wrt=classifier.b)

g_W and g_b are symbolic variables, which can be used as part of a computation graph. The function train_model, which performs one step of gradient descent, can then be defined as follows:

    # specify how to update the parameters of the model as a list of
    # (variable, update expression) pairs.
    updates = [(classifier.W, classifier.W - learning_rate * g_W),
               (classifier.b, classifier.b - learning_rate * g_b)]

    # compiling a Theano function `train_model` that returns the cost, but in
    # the same time updates the parameter of the model based on the rules
    # defined in `updates`
    train_model = theano.function(
        inputs=[index],
        outputs=cost,
        updates=updates,
        givens={
            x: train_set_x[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size],
            y: train_set_y[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size]
        }
    )

updates is a list of pairs. In each pair, the first element is the symbolic variable to be updated in the step, and the second element is the symbolic function for calculating its new value. Similarly, givens is a dictionary whose keys are symbolic variables and whose values specify their replacements during the step. The function train_model is then defined such that:

    the input is the mini-batch index index that, together with the batch size (which is not an input since it is fixed) defines x with corresponding labels y
    the return value is the cost/loss associated with the x, y defined by the index
    on every function call, it will first replace x and y with the slices from the training set specified by index. Then, it will evaluate the cost associated with that minibatch and apply the operations defined by the updates list.

Each time train_model(index) is called, it will thus compute and return the cost of a minibatch, while also performing a step of MSGD. The entire learning algorithm thus consists in looping over all examples in the dataset, considering all the examples in one minibatch at a time, and repeatedly calling the train_model function.
Testing the model

As explained in Learning a Classifier, when testing the model we are interested in the number of misclassified examples (and not only in the likelihood). The LogisticRegression class therefore has an extra instance method, which builds the symbolic graph for retrieving the number of misclassified examples in each minibatch.

The code is as follows:

    def errors(self, y):
        """Return a float representing the number of errors in the minibatch
        over the total number of examples of the minibatch ; zero one
        loss over the size of the minibatch

        :type y: theano.tensor.TensorType
        :param y: corresponds to a vector that gives for each example the
                  correct label
        """

        # check if y has same dimension of y_pred
        if y.ndim != self.y_pred.ndim:
            raise TypeError(
                'y should have the same shape as self.y_pred',
                ('y', y.type, 'y_pred', self.y_pred.type)
            )
        # check if y is of the correct datatype
        if y.dtype.startswith('int'):
            # the T.neq operator returns a vector of 0s and 1s, where 1
            # represents a mistake in prediction
            return T.mean(T.neq(self.y_pred, y))
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError()

We then create a function test_model and a function validate_model, which we can call to retrieve this value. As you will see shortly, validate_model is key to our early-stopping implementation (see Early-Stopping). These functions take a minibatch index and compute, for the examples in that minibatch, the number that were misclassified by the model. The only difference between them is that test_model draws its minibatches from the testing set, while validate_model draws its from the validation set.


    # compiling a Theano function that computes the mistakes that are made by
    # the model on a minibatch
    test_model = theano.function(
        inputs=[index],
        outputs=classifier.errors(y),
        givens={
            x: test_set_x[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size],
            y: test_set_y[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size]
        }
    )

    validate_model = theano.function(
        inputs=[index],
        outputs=classifier.errors(y),
        givens={
            x: valid_set_x[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size],
            y: valid_set_y[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size]
        }
    )

Putting it All Together

The finished product is as follows.

"""
This tutorial introduces logistic regression using Theano and stochastic
gradient descent.

Logistic regression is a probabilistic, linear classifier. It is parametrized
by a weight matrix :math:`W` and a bias vector :math:`b`. Classification is
done by projecting data points onto a set of hyperplanes, the distance to
which is used to determine a class membership probability.

Mathematically, this can be written as:

.. math::
  P(Y=i|x, W,b) &= softmax_i(W x + b) \\
                &= \frac {e^{W_i x + b_i}} {\sum_j e^{W_j x + b_j}}


The output of the model or prediction is then done by taking the argmax of
the vector whose i'th element is P(Y=i|x).

.. math::

  y_{pred} = argmax_i P(Y=i|x,W,b)


This tutorial presents a stochastic gradient descent optimization method
suitable for large datasets.
